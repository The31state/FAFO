# FAFO Calculator

Hey there.

This is the Fuck Around and Find Out Calculator.

Basically, it tells you exactly how much you’re gonna Find Out depending on how much you decided to Fuck Around. Super scientific. Sort of.

---

## The Formula

FindOut(FA) = e^(K(t, d, i) * FA)

Where:

- FA = How much you fucked around
- K(t, d, i) = How badly you set yourself up, based on:
  - Time (t) – How long you kept going
  - Distance (d) – How many people you dragged into your nonsense
  - Intensity (i) – How hard you went for it

K(t, d, i) = 0.125 * t + 0.5 * d + 0.25 * i

## Scales

Time (t):
1 = Just a quick moment
2 = A few minutes
3 = Half an hour or so
4 = A couple hours
5 = All damn day

Distance (d):
1 = Only you
2 = You and maybe one buddy
3 = A small group
4 = Everyone you work with
5 = Literally everybody

Intensity (i):
1 = Mild curiosity
2 = Testing the waters
3 = Getting pretty bold
4 = Full commitment
5 = Zero chill, total chaos

## How to Use This Thing

1. Make sure you have Python 3 on your machine.
2. Download or clone this project.
3. Run:

   python3 fafo_calculator.py

4. Answer the questions about your level of fuckery.
5. Find out exactly how bad it’s gonna get.

## Example

How long did you fuck around? (Time 1-5): 4
How many people were involved? (Distance 1-5): 3
How intense was the fuckery? (Intensity 1-5): 5
How much did you fuck around overall? (FA number): 2

Alright, here’s what you got yourself into:
K(t, d, i) = 3.250
FindOut(FA) = e^(3.250 * 2.0) = 665.141

Translation: You’re about to find out. Big time.

This is just for fun.
If you actually do find out, that’s on you.
